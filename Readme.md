# Correct and incorrect examples of using height=100% in HTML


<p>The main problem with applying height - 100% to HTML elements is that if you wish to set a relative height to an HTML element, all its parent HTML element's 'height' style <strong>must</strong> be initialized. If there is any parent with a non-initialized height, it collapses all its children. This example demonstrates this behavior.</p><p><strong>See also:</strong><strong><br />
